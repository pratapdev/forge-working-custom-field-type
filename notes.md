# Custom Field Multi-Cascade App - Development Notes

## Overview
This document contains notes about the development, issues encountered, and solutions implemented for the Custom Field Multi-Cascade app for Jira.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Auto-Submit Behavior Issue
**Problem**: The form was closing immediately when users made selections in any dropdown, preventing them from completing their selections.

**Solution**: 
- Removed auto-submit logic from all dropdown onChange handlers
- Users can now make selections in all three dropdowns without the form closing immediately
- Added explicit Save/Cancel buttons for form submission

**Files Modified**: 
- `static/src/ui/App.tsx` - Removed auto-submit calls in onChange handlers

### 2. Save Button Visibility Issue
**Problem**: Save button was not visible in issue-view context after removing auto-submit behavior.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit Save button rendering for issue-view context
- Ensured Save button is visible in all contexts (issue view, create, transition, panel)

**Files Modified**:
- `static/src/ui/App.tsx` - Added save button for issue-view context

### 3. Circular Reference Error
**Problem**: "TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON" error when submitting in issue creation screen.

**Solution**:
- Created completely clean objects with only primitive values for submission
- Ensured no DOM elements or event objects are included in the payload
- Used explicit object creation with only the required field values

**Files Modified**:
- `static/src/ui/App.tsx` - Fixed formValueSubmit and handleSubmit functions to create clean objects

### 4. Cancel Button Error
**Problem**: "fs: this resource's view is not closable" error when clicking cancel button.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped view.close() calls in try-catch blocks
- Added fallback behavior to clear form when view cannot be closed

**Files Modified**:
- `static/src/ui/App.tsx` - Added error handling for view.close() calls

### 5. Save Button Feedback Issue
**Problem**: No clear indication that save operation completed successfully.

**Solution**:
- Added success state and message display
- Show "Field saved successfully!" message after successful save
- Automatically close form in dialogs after successful save
- Clear success message after 3 seconds

**Files Modified**:
- `static/src/ui/App.tsx` - Added saveSuccess state and UI feedback

## Dynamic Dropdown Implementation

### 6. Dynamic Dropdown Generation
**Problem**: Dropdowns were hardcoded, making it difficult to modify the number or configuration of fields.

**Solution**:
- Implemented dynamic dropdown generation based on JSON data structure
- Created flexible data structure that defines fields, dependencies, and options
- Added support for any number of dropdowns with proper cascading behavior

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic UI generation from JSON configuration
- Flexible dependency management between fields
- Automatic clearing of dependent fields when parent values change
- Support for required field indicators
- Scalable architecture that supports different numbers of dropdowns

**Files Modified**:
- `src/data.ts` - Created dynamic data structure
- `static/src/ui/App.tsx` - Implemented dynamic dropdown generation
- `src/index.ts` - Updated to use dynamic data
- `scripts/build.mjs` - Added JSON loader support

### 7. Data Structure Design
**Flexible Configuration**:
- Fields array defines each dropdown with id, label, type, and required status
- Dependency management through dependsOn property
- OptionData object provides dynamic options based on parent selections
- Support for nested cascading relationships

**Sample Structure**:
```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "id": "category",
      "label": "Category",
      "type": "dropdown",
      "required": true,
      "options": [...]
    },
    {
      "id": "subcategory",
      "label": "Subcategory",
      "type": "dropdown",
      "required": true,
      "options": [],
      "dependsOn": "category"
    }
  ],
  "optionData": {
    "parentValue": [
      {
        "value": "childValue",
        "label": "Child Label"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Form Submission
The form submission now works by:
1. Creating a clean object with only the field values (category, subcategory, item)
2. Stringifying this clean object for submission
3. Providing clear feedback to the user about the success or failure of the operation

### Context Handling
The app properly handles different Jira contexts:
- **Issue View**: Shows save button, no cancel button, automatically closes after save
- **Create/Transition/Panel**: Shows both save and cancel buttons, automatically closes after save

### Error Handling
All operations now have proper error handling:
- Try-catch blocks around view operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation when operations fail

## Testing Results
The app now works correctly in all contexts:
- ✅ Main issue view
- ✅ Issue popup/panel 
- ✅ Issue creation forms
- ✅ Issue transition forms

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Clean Data Submission**: Only primitive values are sent in the payload
2. **Proper Error Handling**: All operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks
3. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages are displayed
4. **Context Awareness**: Behavior adapts to different Jira contexts
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors when operations fail
6. **Dynamic Configuration**: Flexible data-driven UI generation
7. **Scalable Architecture**: Support for variable numbers of dropdowns

## Future Enhancements (Planned)
1. Add clear buttons for individual dropdowns
2. Add complete form reset button
3. Improve UI styling to match Jira's design language
4. Add validation for required fields
5. Support for different field types beyond dropdowns
6. External configuration management for dynamic data updates
