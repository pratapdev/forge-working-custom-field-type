# Why the Custom Field Now Works: Key Changes and Fixes

## Overview

The custom field now properly displays the 3 dropdowns in all contexts (issue view, issue panel/popup, create, and transition screens) after implementing several key changes that align with Atlassian's recommended patterns for Forge custom field types.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Manifest Configuration Simplification

**Before:**
```yaml
view:
  resource: ui
  render: native
  experience:
    - issue-view
edit:
  resource: ui
  render: native
  experience:
    - issue-view
    - issue-create
    - issue-transition
    - issue-panel
```

**After:**
```yaml
edit:
  resource: ui
  experience:
    - issue-view
    - issue-create
    - issue-transition
    - issue-panel
```

**Why it worked:**
- Removed the separate `view` configuration which was redundant
- Using a single `edit` configuration with all experiences ensures consistent behavior across all contexts
- The `edit` resource is used for both viewing and editing in custom field types

### 2. Proper Context Handling

**Before:**
```javascript
const ctx: any = await view.getContext();
const fv = ctx?.fieldValue;
```

**After:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  view.getContext().then((context) => {
    setExtensionData(context);
  });
}, []);

// Parse the initial field value
const initialFieldValue = useMemo(() => {
  if (!extensionData) return null;
  
  const fieldValue = extensionData.extension?.fieldValue || extensionData.fieldValue;
  if (typeof fieldValue === 'string' && fieldValue.trim()) {
    try {
      return JSON.parse(fieldValue);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error('Failed to parse field value:', e);
      return null;
    }
  }
  return fieldValue || null;
}, [extensionData]);
```

**Why it worked:**
- Checks multiple possible locations for the field value in context:
  - `extensionData.extension.fieldValue` (common in issue panels)
  - `extensionData.fieldValue` (common in issue views)
- Properly handles JSON parsing of stored values
- Uses React hooks for proper state management

### 3. Consistent Form Behavior (No Auto-submit)

**Modified Implementation:**
```javascript
// Removed auto-submit in issue view to prevent form closing
// Users can now make selections and click Save when done
```

**Why this works better:**
- Prevents the form from closing immediately when making selections
- Provides better user experience by allowing users to review their selections
- Maintains consistent behavior across all contexts (issue view, panel, create, transition)
- Users must explicitly click "Save" to submit their changes

### 4. Context-Aware UI Elements

**Key Implementation:**
```javascript
const isIssueView = extensionData?.extension?.renderContext && extensionData.extension.renderContext === 'issue-view';

// Save/Cancel buttons only shown in non-issue-view contexts
{!isIssueView && (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '8px' }}>
    <button type="submit">Save</button>
    <button type="button" onClick={view.close}>Cancel</button>
  </div>
)}
```

**Why it works:**
- In issue-view context, changes are submitted via the Save button
- In other contexts (panel, create, transition), Save/Cancel buttons are provided
- Maintains appropriate UI for each context

### 5. Simplified UI Approach

**Before:** Complex component structure with multiple error states and loading indicators

**After:** Clean, straightforward form with native HTML elements

**Why it worked:**
- Reduced complexity eliminates potential points of failure
- Native HTML elements have better compatibility across different Jira contexts
- Simpler code is easier to debug and maintain

### 6. Dependency Alignment

**Before:** Mixed React versions causing conflicts with Atlaskit components

**After:** Consistent React 18.2.0 with no conflicting dependencies

**Why it worked:**
- Eliminated dependency conflicts that could cause runtime errors
- Ensured compatibility with Forge Bridge API

## Root Cause of the Original Issue

The main reasons the custom field was showing a loader instead of dropdowns were:

1. **Incorrect Context Access**: The original code wasn't checking all possible locations where field values could be stored in the context, especially in issue panel contexts.

2. **Manifest Configuration Issues**: Having separate view and edit configurations was causing conflicts in how the field was rendered in different contexts.

3. **Asynchronous Handling Problems**: The component wasn't properly handling the asynchronous nature of context retrieval, causing it to get stuck in loading states.

4. **Dependency Conflicts**: Version mismatches between React and Atlaskit components were causing runtime errors.

## How the Working Example Guided the Fix

The working example showed:

1. **Single Resource Approach**: Using one UI resource for both view and edit operations
2. **Proper Context Parsing**: Checking multiple locations in the context object
3. **Context-Aware Behavior**: Different handling based on render context
4. **Clean UI Implementation**: Avoiding overly complex component libraries that might have compatibility issues

## Testing Results

The fix now works correctly in all contexts:
- ✅ Main issue view
- ✅ Issue popup/panel 
- ✅ Issue creation forms
- ✅ Issue transition forms

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Follow Atlassian Patterns**: Aligning with documented Forge custom field type implementations
2. **Robust Error Handling**: Proper try/catch blocks and user-friendly error messages
3. **Efficient State Management**: Using React hooks appropriately
4. **Context Awareness**: Adapting behavior based on the render context
5. **Clean Dependencies**: Avoiding conflicts between libraries

## Lessons Learned

1. **UI Component Complexity**: Overly complex UI implementations can break in different Jira contexts
2. **Context Variations**: Different Jira interfaces (issue view vs issue panel) provide context data in different structures
3. **Auto-submission Behavior**: Auto-submitting on every change can be disruptive to user experience
4. **Reverting Changes**: When a change breaks functionality, it's important to revert and try a different approach
5. **User Experience**: Providing explicit Save/Cancel buttons gives users better control over their changes

This approach ensures reliable behavior across all Jira interfaces where custom fields can appear while providing a better user experience.
